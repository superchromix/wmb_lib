;    wmb_lib/h5tb: 
;    
;    HDF5 Table API for IDL
;    
;    The wmb_hdf5* library implements the basic functions for reading and 
;    writing HDF5 tables from IDL.  This library was created by porting the 
;    C code from the HDF5 distribution (H5TB.c, from HDF5 version 1.8.10) 
;    and modifying it to work with the HDF5 API currently supported by IDL 
;    (as of IDL version 8.2, most of the HDF5 version 1.6 API is supported).
;               
;    The C source code which this library is based on can be found
;    at the following location:
;       
;    http://www.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/current/src/unpacked/hl/src/H5TB.c
;    
;    By translating this code into IDL, the following functions were ported:
;           
;    Table creation:
;       
;        wmb_h5tb_make_table.pro
;    
;    Storage:
;       
;        wmb_h5tb_append_records.pro
;        wmb_h5tb_write_records.pro
;        wmb_h5tb_write_fields_index.pro
;        wmb_h5tb_write_fields_name.pro
;           
;    Retrieval: 
;       
;        wmb_h5tb_read_table.pro
;        wmb_h5tb_read_records.pro
;        wmb_h5tb_read_fields_index.pro
;        wmb_h5tb_read_fields_name.pro
;           
;    Query:
;       
;        wmb_h5tb_get_table_info.pro
;        wmb_h5tb_get_field_info.pro
;           
;    Modification:
;       
;        wmb_h5tb_insert_records.pro
;        wmb_h5tb_add_records_from.pro
;        wmb_h5tb_combine_tables.pro
;    
;    Several of the H5TB* functiions from the could not
;    be ported, due to limitations of the current version of the 
;    IDL HDF5 implementation.  These functions are listed below, 
;    along with the reasons why they could not be ported.
;       
;    H5TB_delete_record:  Currently, IDL does not implement the
;                         H5D_set_extent function, and therefore
;                         there is no way to reduce the size of
;                         an existing dataset.
;    
;    H5TB_insert_field:   The version of H5D_write implemented by
;    and                  IDL does not allow the specification of 
;    H5TB_delete_field    a "write datatype id", which is required
;                         to enable the selective writing of a subset
;                         of the fields within a table.  Also, IDL does 
;                         not allow the chunk dimensions and the 
;                         compression state of an existing dataset 
;                         to be queried.
