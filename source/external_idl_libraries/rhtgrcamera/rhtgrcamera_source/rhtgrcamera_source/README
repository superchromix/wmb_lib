
This directory contains the RHTgrCamera class and supporting files.

Copy the .dlm and .dll files to a directory in your !DLM_PATH.  By default
!DLM_PATH is set to !PATH at startup.  You can also set your IDL_DLM_PATH
environment variable.  See the "IDL Environment System Variables" section of
the IDL docs for more information.

This is the source distribution.  The source code, simple makefiles, and
.dlm files are contained in the dlm directory.  You will most likely need to
edit the makefiles to get them to work for your platform.
